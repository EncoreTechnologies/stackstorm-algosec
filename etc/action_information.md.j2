# Actions

Actions in this pack are auto-generated from the AlgoSec SOAP API operations defined in the WSDL file
(note: we store these WSDLs in the `etc/` directory of this pack). There is
an action created for every "Command" in the AlgoSec API. Input and output
parameters should be the same with all action names and action parameters
convert from CamelCase to snake_case with a few expecptions. Example: SOAP command IsSessionAlive
will be converted to snake_case for the action to become `algosec.is_session_alive`.
In this same command one of the arguments is `SessionID` that becomes the
`session_id` action parameter.

| Reference of the Action | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|{% for action in all_actions %}
| {{ action.name }} | {{ action.description }} |{% endfor %}
